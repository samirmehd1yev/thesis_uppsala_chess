# Feature Analysis for Chess Player Type Classification

## Key Findings

1. **Optimal Number of Clusters**: 2 clusters were identified as optimal based on silhouette score, which aligns with the theoretical framework of 4 player types.

2. **Top Discriminative Features**:
   - opening_accuracy, piece_mobility_avg, sharpness, center_control_avg, king_safety

3. **Player Type Characteristics**:
   - **Activists**: Characterized by great_count
   - **Theorists**: Characterized by 
   - **Reflectors**: Characterized by eval_volatility
   - **Pragmatists**: Characterized by 

4. **Feature Correlations**:
   - Highly correlated feature pairs include: avg_eval_change/eval_volatility (0.96), material_changes/capture_frequency_black (0.93), capture_frequency_white/material_changes (0.92)
   - This suggests potential for dimensionality reduction.

5. **Variance Explained**:
   - PCA analysis reveals that 37.99% of variance is explained by the first 3 principal components.

## Recommendations for Clustering

1. Consider using the following feature subset for clustering:
   opening_accuracy
   piece_mobility_avg
   sharpness
   center_control_avg
   king_safety
   vulnerability_spikes
   space_advantage_white
   king_safety_min
   prophylactic_frequency
   middlegame_accuracy

2. Apply appropriate scaling before clustering (StandardScaler recommended).

3. Experiment with both K-Means (k=2) and hierarchical clustering.

4. Validate clusters against known player types to establish ground truth.
