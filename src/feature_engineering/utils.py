Chess Move Analyzer
===================

This module implements a chess move analyzer using the Stockfish engine.
It is inspired by Lichess's move analysis code and provides functionality to:
  - Evaluate positions using Stockfish.
  - Generate advice (e.g., Inaccuracy, Mistake, Blunder) based on evaluation differences.
  - Handle mate evaluations and convert them to advice.
  - Parse a PGN-like moves string into board positions.
  - Determine game phase transitions (opening, middlegame, endgame).
  - Format and print a detailed analysis summary.

Dependencies:
  - python-chess
  - stockfish (python wrapper)
  - tqdm (for progress visualization)
